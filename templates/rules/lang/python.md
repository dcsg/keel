<governance_checkpoint>
Before modifying any file, pause and verify:
1. List which rules from this file apply to the change you are about to make.
2. Check if the change uses mutable defaults, bare excepts, or violates PEP conventions.
3. If multiple rules conflict, state the conflict before proceeding.
After receiving tool results (test output, lint output, build errors), re-check:
1. Verify the result complies with the rules you identified above.
2. If it does not, fix the violation before taking any other action.
3. Do not chain corrections — verify each step against these rules before proceeding.

# Python

Rules for writing clean, idiomatic Python code.

## Critical

- NEVER use bare `except:` or `except Exception:` without re-raising — it swallows every exception including KeyboardInterrupt and SystemExit. Catch the specific exception type you expect.
- NEVER use `from module import *` — it pollutes the namespace and makes the source of names impossible to trace.
- MUST add type hints to all function signatures (parameters and return types). Run mypy or pyright in CI — hints without a checker are documentation, not safety.

## Standards

- Catch specific exceptions, not broad ones. If you need to catch broad exceptions (e.g., at a top-level handler), log and re-raise.
- Use context managers (`with`) for all resource management: files, connections, locks. Don't manually call `.close()`.
- Use `dataclasses` or Pydantic `BaseModel` for structured data — not plain dicts. Use `frozen=True` on dataclasses for immutable value objects. Use Pydantic for data from external sources.
- Follow PEP 8: `snake_case` for functions and variables, `PascalCase` for classes, `UPPER_SNAKE` for constants. Boolean names use `is_`, `has_`, `can_` prefixes.
- Import order: standard library, third-party, local — separated by blank lines. Use absolute imports. Never use relative imports for top-level packages.
- Use `asyncio` for I/O-bound concurrency. NEVER call blocking I/O inside an async function — use `asyncio.to_thread()`. Use `asyncio.gather()` or `asyncio.TaskGroup()` (3.11+) for concurrent tasks.

## Practices

- Use `from __future__ import annotations` for forward references and modern annotation syntax on Python 3.9 and earlier.
- Use `pyproject.toml` for project configuration — not `setup.py` or `setup.cfg`.
- Keep `__init__.py` minimal. It defines the public API — import what should be public, leave internals private. Don't put logic in it.
- One concern per module. Don't put models, views, and utilities in the same file.
- Use `pytest.mark.parametrize` for table-driven tests. Use `pytest.fixture` for shared setup.
- Consider `typing.Protocol` over abstract base classes for structural subtyping — it removes the inheritance requirement for callers.

## Critical

- NEVER use bare `except:` — always catch the specific exception type.
- MUST type-hint all function signatures and run a type checker in CI.
